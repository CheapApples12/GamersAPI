## Downloading the APIs
GamersAPI is Open Source, which means you're free to use the API's, as long as you do not remove the attribution statements from the top of the API's, and as long as you don't attempt to market the API as your own, or attempt to charge money for people to use the API's.

GamersAPI does not need composer, or any third-party software. The only requirements are as follows:

 - PHP => 5.0
 - allow_url_fopen allowed

If you do not want to download the api's, you are welcome to use our [Heroku hosted API's](#using-the-apis).
