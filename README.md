## Includes APIs



## Using the APIs
This section contains the API's, example uses, example responses and response content-type.

### KiK API
KiK Messenger does not offer a user information API. We rely solely on people doing the right thing, and not abusing the API. KiK is a popular choice of messaging app for gaming communities; it's a fast, secure, convenient messenger, and it's all-round pretty awesome.

Our API allows you to get a user's display name, KiK avatar and a secure (https) version of the user's KiK avatar.

The API can be accessed via:



## Downloading the APIs
GamersAPI is Open Source, which means you're free to use the API's, as long as you do not remove the attribution statements from the top of the API's, and as long as you don't attempt to market the API as your own, or attempt to charge money for people to use the API's.

GamersAPI does not need composer, or any third-party software. The only requirements are as follows:

 - PHP => 5.0
 - allow_url_fopen allowed

If you do not want to download the api's, you are welcome to use our [Heroku hosted API's](#using-the-apis).
